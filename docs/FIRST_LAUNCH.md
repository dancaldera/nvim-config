# 🎉 First Launch Guide - Neovim with AI

Welcome to your optimized Neovim configuration! Follow these simple steps to get started.

## ✅ Step 1: First Launch

When you first open Neovim:

```bash
nvim
```

**What will happen:**
1. ✨ Lazy.nvim will install all plugins automatically
2. 📦 Mason will install LSP servers in the background
3. 🎨 Dashboard will show (press `q` to close or select an option)
4. ⏳ Wait ~30 seconds for everything to install

## ✅ Step 2: Setup AI Completion (REQUIRED!)

**This is the most important step!**

In Neovim, run:
```vim
:Copilot auth
```

**What will happen:**
1. 🌐 Your browser will open
2. 🔐 Sign in with your GitHub account
3. 📋 Enter the one-time code shown in Neovim
4. ✅ Authorize GitHub Copilot
5. ✅ Done!

**Done! AI completion is now active!** 🎉

**Note:** GitHub Copilot requires a subscription (free for students, educators, and open source maintainers).

## ✅ Step 3: Test AI Completion

1. Create a new file:
   ```vim
   :e test.js
   ```

2. Enter INSERT mode:
   ```
   Press: i
   ```

3. Start typing:
   ```javascript
   function add
   ```

4. **Look for gray ghost text** - that's the AI suggestion!

5. **Press `<Ctrl-g>` to accept it!** 🚀

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Run health checks:
```vim
:checkhealth
```

Check LSP servers:
```vim
:Mason
```

Check plugins:
```vim
:Lazy
```
